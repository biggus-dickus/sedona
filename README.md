# Sedona
Because the Grand Canyon sucks!

## Description
This is the second (the first one is [Pink](http://biggus-dickus.github.io/pink)) template for practicing from [HTML Academy](http://htmlacademy.ru). Here I employed adaptive and fluid layout techniques together with responsive images (retina@2x and svg), custom-built icon fonts, svg and traditional png sprites.

The original design encompassed three resolutions (mobile, tablet and desktop), with four breakpoints envisaged by me: 
* at 321px,
* at 480px,
* at 768px,
* and at 1280px.

**Main technologies employed:** [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a project build tool. See `packaje.json` for the list of plugins/dependencies and `gulp.js` for details of my workflow.

## How to deploy
To quickly build the project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the project from Github.
2. Install the necessary Node modules via NPM (run `npm install` in your console while in the project root directory). Note: you also need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
3. Run `gulp` command in the console.
