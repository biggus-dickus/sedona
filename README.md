# Sedona
**Because the Grand Canyon sucks!**

[View on gh-pages](http://biggus-dickus.github.io/sedona/).

## Description
This is the second (the first one is [Pink](http://biggus-dickus.github.io/pink)) template for practice from [HTML Academy](http://htmlacademy.ru). Here I employed adaptive and fluid layout techniques together with responsive images (retina@2x and svg), custom-built icon fonts, svg and traditional png sprites.

The original design encompassed three resolutions (mobile, tablet and desktop), with four breakpoints envisaged by me: 
* at 321px,
* at 480px,
* at 767px,
* and at 1280px.

**Main technologies employed:** [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) as CSS preprocessor and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as project build tool. See `package.json` for the list of plugins/dependencies and `gulpfile.js` for details of my workflow.

## How to deploy

1. Clone the project from Github.
2. Install all required dependencies via NPM (run `npm install` in your terminal while in the project root directory). *Note:* you also need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.
3. Run `gulp` command in the terminal window.
